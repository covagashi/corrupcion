# Roadmap

Steps to build the Philippine anti-corruption site, in order. Check items off as you go.
Architecture and data sources are in [data-sources.md](data-sources.md); design rules and the
irregularity-metric definition are in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Architecture (decided)

```
GitHub Actions (cron, monthly)
  1. discover download URLs via the BetterGov catalog API (https://data.bettergov.ph/api/v1)
  2. download the Parquet / JSON data files
  3. compute the irregularity metric + politician/owner alignment
  4. wrangler d1 import  ->  Cloudflare D1
Cloudflare Worker (SvelteKit SSR) -> reads D1 -> small HTML to mobile
```

Heavy work happens offline in CI; the Worker only reads precomputed rows. The catalog API is a
**discovery layer used by the pipeline**, never called at request time. Verified working 2026-06-15.

## Phase 0 — Base ✅ (done)

- [x] SvelteKit + TS + Tailwind + Cloudflare Workers adapter scaffolded
- [x] Repo published: https://github.com/covagashi/corrupcion (public)
- [x] Data sources documented and live-tested

## Phase 1 — First dataset end to end: Flood Control

Smallest, richest, highest-impact dataset (9,855 records, 16 MB). Goal: one real page live.

- [x] `pipeline/fetch.py`: download Flood Control JSON
      (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bettergovph/bettergov/refs/heads/main/src/data/flood_control/flood_control.json`)
- [x] `pipeline/transform.py`: parse the ArcGIS feature format; extract the useful fields.
      Note: `GlobalID` is the primary key (`ContractID` is not unique — 9,698/9,855).
- [x] Compute first irregularity signals (in `transform.py`):
  - [x] **bid-to-ceiling ratio** = `ContractCost / ABC`. A flat ≥0.99 flag is useless here — 73% of
        the dataset sits at the ceiling, so it's the norm, not a signal. Layered instead:
        `OVER_CEILING` (>1.0, awarded above the legal ceiling — 770 rows, the strong signal),
        `EXACT_CEILING` (≥0.9999), `NEAR_CEILING` (≥0.99, context only).
  - [x] **supplier concentration** — `DISTRICT_DOMINANCE`: one contractor holds ≥50% of a
        legislative district's contract value across ≥3 contracts (21 pairs / 270 contracts).
- [x] Output a `.sql` dump (`pipeline/out/contracts.sql`, batched 50 rows/INSERT for D1's
      statement-length limit). `risk_score` (0–100) is the transparent sum of fired-flag weights.
- [x] D1: schema defined (`db/schema.sql`), binding activated in `wrangler.jsonc`, loaded into the
      **local** D1 (`wrangler d1 execute --local`). Remote `wrangler d1 create` + real `database_id`
      still pending (needs `wrangler login`).
- [x] UI: contract list page (mobile-first) — riskiest first, search, plain-language flag per row
- [x] UI: contract detail page explaining each flag in one sentence + the money + district standing

## Phase 2 — Automate the refresh

Full deploy instructions (local + CI) in [deploy.md](deploy.md).

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow: pipeline → load D1 → deploy, on a monthly cron + manual dispatch
      (`.github/workflows/refresh.yml`)
- [x] Step to load results into D1 via `wrangler d1 execute --remote` (idempotent schema + rows)
- [x] Deploy the site (`wrangler deploy`) — wired in the workflow
- [ ] **Manual one-time setup (you):** create the D1 db, paste its `database_id` into
      `wrangler.jsonc`, add repo secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`,
      then run the workflow once. See [deploy.md](deploy.md).

## Phase 3 — Add the big contract datasets

- [x] PhilGEPS (`philgeps.parquet`, ~470 MB / 5.48M rows — all agencies) into the pipeline
- [x] Adapt the metric: legal threshold-splitting detection — amounts clustered just below the
      RA 9184 SVP threshold (`T = ₱1,000,000`, verified; RA 12009 raises it to ₱2,000,000 from 2025).
      Full statistic (observed vs expected under a smooth log-linear tail, excess count/value) in
      [methodology.md](methodology.md#phase-3--threshold-splitting-implemented). Surfaced as the
      `BELOW_THRESHOLD_CLUSTER` flag plus the `/threshold-splitting` page.
- [x] DPWH Infrastructure (`dpwh_transparency_data.parquet`, 248,220 projects) into the pipeline.
      Schema verified; mapped to `source='dpwh'` rows with the `OVER_BUDGET` flag (amount paid >
      approved budget). See [methodology.md](methodology.md#phase-3b--dpwh-infrastructure-projects-implemented).
      (The Hugging Face download path in `fetch.py` still needs a live confirmation — see
      [pending-data-run.md](pending-data-run.md).)
- [x] Unified search across all contracts (server-side, returns small HTML). The list spans both
      sources, with a Flood Control / PhilGEPS source filter; search matches contractor, description,
      district, procuring entity, province and category; the list and detail pages render
      source-appropriate fields (ceiling/ratio for flood control, agency/category/award year for
      PhilGEPS).

> **Not yet run:** the PhilGEPS pipeline + metric code and the front end are done and type-checked,
> but the end-to-end data run (download `philgeps.parquet` → `transform.py` → seed D1) could not
> execute in the web sandbox (egress blocks `huggingface.co`). Exact remaining steps and how to
> finish them (CI / egress allowlist / logged-in machine) are in
> [pending-data-run.md](pending-data-run.md).

## Phase 4 — Alignment (contracts ↔ politicians ↔ owners)

- [ ] Politicians: Open Congress + SALN data; link by LegislativeDistrict / location
- [ ] Company owners: SEC records; link contractors to incorporators/owners
- [ ] Political-dynasty dataset (Ateneo Policy Center) for clan context
- [ ] Alignment views: "who represents this district + who won the contracts here + who owns them"

## Phase 5 — Polish

- [x] Public methodology page (`/methodology`, plain-language, linked from every footer; flag
      definitions rendered from the same `$lib/flags` source the app uses). Dev-facing spec in
      [methodology.md](methodology.md).
- [ ] Map view of flagged projects (lat/long already in the data)
- [ ] Performance pass for low-end mobile (payload size, no heavy JS)

## Useful commands

```sh
# always prepend portable Node on the original PC (see CLAUDE.local.md)
npm run dev      # dev server
npm run check    # types
npm run gen      # regenerate worker types after editing wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler d1 create corrupcion-db
npx wrangler d1 import corrupcion-db --file=./pipeline/out/contracts.sql
npm run build && npx wrangler deploy
```
