# Data Sources

All data sources for the Philippine anti-corruption platform. The reference repos live one level up
(`D:\3_workbench\Christian\corrupcion\*-main`) — read-only, never modify them.

## Public works contracts — DPWH Transparency API

- Listing: `https://api.transparency.dpwh.gov.ph/projects?page={page}&limit={limit}` (max `limit=5000`)
- Detail: `https://api.transparency.dpwh.gov.ph/projects/{contractId}`
- ~247K projects total. The API sits behind Cloudflare bot protection: plain `fetch` gets blocked
  (403/429/error 1015). Re-verified 2026-06-23 — both `/projects` and `/filters/regions` return
  `403` with `Cf-Mitigated: challenge` / `Server: cloudflare` (a Managed Challenge, same wall as
  ph-check.com), so no `curl`/PowerShell client gets through without solving the JS challenge. The
  reference scraper (`dpwh-transparency-data-api-scraper-main`) works around it with `curl-cffi`
  TLS-fingerprint rotation + proxy rotation. Prefer the bulk datasets below; hit the live API only
  for incremental updates.
- API response shape (confirmed 2026-06-23 from a browser session that passed the challenge):
  `/projects` returns `{status, code, data:{ data:[…projects…], summary, pagination }}` where
  `summary` carries `totalProjects / completed / ongoing / notStarted / forProcurement / terminated /
  totalBudget`, and `pagination` carries `page / limit / totalCount / totalPages / hasNext`.
  `/filters/regions` returns `{status, code, data:[{region}×18]}`. As of that date the live API
  reports **257,779 projects / ₱6.46 T total budget** — i.e. the bulk Parquet snapshot below
  (248,220, 2026-06-18) lags the live data by ~9.5K projects. `location.province` carries the DEO
  suffix (`"Pangasinan 3rd DEO"`), already handled by the DEO-stripping place normalization.
- Bulk Parquet: `dpwh_transparency_data.parquet` — **248,220 projects**, 23 top-level columns
  (verified 2026-06-18): `contractId`, `description`, `category`, `componentCategories`, `status`,
  `budget` (double), `amountPaid` (int64), `progress` (double), `location` (struct `{province,
region}`), `contractor`, `startDate`/`completionDate` (date), `infraYear` (text), `programName`,
  `sourceOfFunds`, `isLive` (bool), `livestreamUrl`/`livestreamVideoId`/`livestreamDetectedAt`
  (json), `latitude`/`longitude` (double), `reportCount` (int64), `hasSatelliteImage` (bool).
  Consumed in `pipeline/dpwh.py` → `source='dpwh'` rows + the `OVER_BUDGET` flag.

## All-agency contracts — PhilGEPS

- Bulk data: Hugging Face `bettergovph/philgeps-data` (~1.95 GB total across the dataset).
  `philgeps.parquet` is the main awarded-contracts table: **~470 MB, 5,481,161 rows** (verified
  2026-06-17). `awardees.parquet` / `organizations.parquet` are kept for Phase 4 alignment.
- `philgeps.parquet` schema — 12 columns: `id` (uuid), `reference_id`, `contract_no`,
  `award_title`, `notice_title`, `awardee_name`, `organization_name`, `area_of_delivery`,
  `business_category`, `contract_amount` (double), `award_date` (timestamp[us]),
  `award_status` (= "active").
- PhilGEPS has no usable public API; bulk downloads are the way in.
- The BetterGovPH pipeline already links ~37K PhilGEPS contracts to DPWH projects.

## BetterGov Open Data Portal API

- Base: `https://data.bettergov.ph/api/v1` (spec: `../openapi.json` at workspace root)
- Endpoints: `/datasets`, `/datasets/{id}`, `/resources?dataset_id=`, `/publishers`, `/categories`, `/stats`
- Catalog API: returns dataset metadata + `download_url` per resource. Rate limits 20–100 req/min.
- Notable: **Ateneo Policy Center Political Dynasties Dataset** (local-government clan tracking) — key
  input for the contracts ↔ politicians alignment.

## Politicians

- **Open Congress** (`open-congress-data-main`, `open-congress-api-main`): senators, representatives,
  bills, congress memberships. Scraped from `web.senate.gov.ph` and `congress.gov.ph`, modeled as a
  Neo4j graph; the API repo (Deno + Hono) shows the REST shape over it.
- **SALN** (`saln-tracker-ph-main`): Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth of public
  officials (President, VP, senators). Coverage is sparse — SALNs are released irregularly. Repo has
  officials data + SALN JSONs in `app/data/`.

## Company ownership

This is the third leg of the contracts ↔ politicians ↔ owners alignment. SEC remains out of reach,
but the **disclosed owner of each PCAB-licensed firm (the AMO)** now covers the "owners" leg.

- **PCAB — Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board** is the live, public source. Its license
  verification pages (`https://pcabgovph.com/verify/`) are jqGrid-backed by phpGrid and reachable in
  bulk via `/phpGrid/data.php?dt=json&gn={Licenses|SuspendedLicenses}`. Two grids are ingested by
  `pipeline/pcab.py` (verified 2026-06-27):
  - `gn=Licenses` — ~18,141 currently-valid regular licenses. Columns: `id, CompanyName, LicenseNum,
    AMO` (Authorized Managing Officer — the disclosed firm owner), `Category` (AAAA / AAA / AA / A /
    B / C / D / E), `ValidTo`, `GovReg` (1 = authorized for government infrastructure projects).
  - `gn=SuspendedLicenses` — the (small) revoked/suspended list. Columns: `id, CompanyName,
    LicenseNum, Status, FromDate, ToDate, Reason`. A contractor in here is the strongest ownership-
    linked signal the site surfaces.
- **phpGrid session warmup:** every `data.php` call returns 200 with a `PHPGRID_ERROR` body *unless*
  you first GET `/verify/` to seed the session cookie. `pipeline/pcab.py` does that warmup, then
  pages at 100 rows/page (~0.4 req/sec self-throttled with an identifying UA).
- **SEC Philippines company registrations** — the underlying data is the SEC **General Information
  Sheet (GIS)**, an annual filing that discloses each corporation's directors, officers and top-20
  stockholders. There is **no public API and no bulk download**; the official portals (eSEARCH /
  eFAST / Check-with-SEC) serve one record at a time, behind paid document requests, and the Revised
  Corporation Code does **not authorize** automated scraping of eSEARCH. So the SEC GIS itself has
  no transparent, auditable bulk feed; PCAB's disclosed AMO is the "owners" leg instead.
- **ph-check.com** (investigated 2026-06-23) — a third-party aggregator that exposes a company-name
  search. **Blocked the same way as the DPWH live API: it sits behind a Cloudflare Managed Challenge.**
  Every request (including `https://ph-check.com/js/userdata.js`) returns `403` with
  `Cf-Mitigated: challenge` / `Server: cloudflare`; the page shows no fetch/XHR because the content
  only loads after a browser solves the JS challenge. Scraping it would need a challenge-solving
  headless browser (à la `dpwh-transparency-data-api-scraper-main`), and even then it is an
  unofficial aggregator, not a primary source — not suitable for a transparent pipeline. Parked.

### Matching PCAB to contracts and officials (Phase 4 alignment)

`pipeline/pcab.py` writes two normalized columns on each PCAB license row:
- `contractor_key` — the firm name uppercased, alphanumerics-only, single-spaced (mirrored by
  `normalizeCompanyKey` in `$lib/server/companies.ts`). The contract detail page matches
  `contracts.contractor` to `pcab_licenses.contractor_key` by equality.
- `owner_surname` — the AMO surname (last token, generational suffixes and particles dropped).
  The contract detail page runs a Phase 4 surname-overlap query (`getSurnameOverlaps` in the same
  server file): officials in the contract's province with a matching `full_name LIKE '% <surname>%'`,
  plus any national legislator with `last_name LIKE '<surname>%'`. The methodology page states this
  is a signal, not proof.
